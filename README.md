# ds-log-2026
Series of works that I'll be working on every week on 2026

## Structure
This repository contains weekly folders for organizing work. Each folder follows the naming convention: `wXX_topic_name`

Examples:
- `w01_example_topic/` - Week 1 work on a specific topic
- `w02_machine_learning/` - Week 2 work on machine learning
- `w03_data_structures/` - Week 3 work on data structures

Each week folder contains:
- A README.md with an overview of that week's topics and work
- Files and code related to that week's topics

## Usage
1. Create a new folder for each week using the format `wXX_topic_name` where XX is zero-padded (e.g., `w01_python_basics`, `w02_sql_queries`, `w10_advanced_algorithms`)
2. Add your work files and documentation for that week
3. Update the week's README.md with relevant information about the topic and your progress
