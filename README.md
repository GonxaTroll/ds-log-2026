# ds-log-2026
Series of works that I'll be working on every week on 2026

## Structure
This repository contains weekly folders for organizing work:
- `week-01/` - Week 1 work
- `week-02/` - Week 2 work
- `week-XX/` - Week XX work

Each week folder contains:
- A README.md with an overview of that week's topics and work
- Files and code related to that week's topics

## Usage
1. Create a new folder for each week (e.g., `week-01`, `week-02`, etc.)
2. Add your work files and documentation for that week
3. Update the week's README.md with relevant information
